        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Associate Scientist (2023 Jun-Present)</strong></p>
            <p>I am currently an Associate Scientist within the <a href="https://www.swgo.org/SWGOWiki/doku.php">SWGO Collaboration</a>, an international research initiative focused on the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) Experiment. I am working with the National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN) Padova and the University of Padova in simulations and optimization work</p>
            <p><strong>External Collaborator (2023 Feb-Sep)</strong></p>
            <p>I had the extraordinary opportunity to collaborate with the renowned <a href="https://userswww.pd.infn.it/~dorigo/">Dr. Tommaso Dorigo</a>, an esteemed researcher, during my involvement in the Southern Wide-Field Gamma Observatory experiment. This collaboration was centered around conducting optimization work in conjunction with the prestigious University of Padova and the National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN) Italy. Working alongside Dr. Dorigo, a visionary in the field, was an awe-inspiring experience that allowed me to witness the beauty of scientific exploration unfold before my eyes. Together, we delved into the depths of gamma observatory research, embarking on a quest to uncover the secrets of the universe and contribute to the advancement of knowledge</p>
            <p><strong>Intern (2022 DEC-2023 JAN)</strong></p>
            <p>I was fortunate to embark on an enriching internship under the esteemed guidance of <a href="https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/faculty/dbs/shashibp">Dr. Shashi Bhushan Pandit</a> in the captivating realm of computational and structural biology. This immersive experience allowed me to employ diverse computer methods to delve deep into the intricate world of protein structures. Collaborating closely with Dr. Pandit, a true visionary in the field, I witnessed the harmonious fusion of biology and technology, as we unraveled the mysteries of complex biological systems. Through this internship, I not only gained valuable insights into the fascinating realm of computational biology but also developed a profound appreciation for the elegant intricacies that govern the structural framework of life itself.</p>
